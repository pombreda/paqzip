The best ratio compressor(paq8, using the lpaq8 version) + the most popular archive file format(zip).

Integration of lpaq8 + info-zip

zip is quick at deleting/adding/extracting specific files to the archive, you don't have to uncompress the whole archive to delete/add/extract one file.  Because of these flexible features the compression ratio isn't as good as tar+lpaq,lpq,etc. especially when you have lots of smaller files in the archive.

By default zip is set to lpaq, to use normal zip again use the "-Zdeflate" option

Gimme a message if it crashes or something.
